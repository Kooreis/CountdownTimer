# Python Countdown Timer

This Python script is a simple countdown timer. The user inputs the time in seconds and the script will count down to zero from the given time, displaying the remaining time in a minute:second format. When the time is up, it will print 'Time Up!!'.

## Code Explanation

The script is composed of a single function `countdown(t)`, which takes an integer `t` as an argument. This integer represents the time in seconds for the countdown.

The function uses a while loop to continuously decrease the time by one second until it reaches zero. Inside the loop, the `divmod(t, 60)` function is used to convert the time from seconds to minutes and seconds. The remaining time is then formatted into a string in the format 'MM:SS' using the `format()` function.

The `print()` function is used to display the remaining time. The `end="\r"` argument is used to overwrite the current line in the console, creating the effect of a continuously updating timer.

Finally, the `time.sleep(1)` function is used to pause the execution of the script for one second between each iteration of the loop, effectively decreasing the time by one second at a time.

## Imported Libraries

The script imports the `time` module from the Python Standard Library. This module provides various time-related functions. In this script, it is used for the `sleep()` function, which suspends (delays) execution of the current thread for a given number of seconds.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it in a Python environment. You will be prompted to enter the time in seconds for the countdown. After entering the time, the countdown will start and the remaining time will be displayed in the console. When the time is up, 'Time Up!!' will be printed to the console.

## Example

```python
Enter the time in seconds: 120
01:59
01:58
...
00:01
Time Up!!
```

This script is a simple and effective way to create a countdown timer in Python. It can be easily modified or expanded to suit your needs.

# C# Documentation

# Countdown Timer in C#

This repository contains a simple console-based countdown timer written in C#. The script prompts the user to input a time in seconds, then counts down to zero, displaying the remaining time in the format `hh:mm:ss`.

## Script Explanation

The script begins by asking the user to input the countdown time in seconds. It then enters a loop, where it updates the console display with the remaining time every second, until the countdown reaches zero. At this point, the console is cleared and a message is displayed to indicate that the countdown is complete.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses the following libraries:

- `System`: This is a fundamental library in C# that provides classes for input/output via streams, string manipulation, mathematical functions, and more. In this script, it is used for console input/output and for converting the user's input to an integer.

- `System.Threading`: This library provides classes for multithreaded programming. In this script, it is used to pause the execution of the script for one second between each update of the countdown timer.

## Code Snippet

```CSharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace CountdownTimer
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.Write("Enter the countdown time in seconds: ");
            int countTime = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            Console.Clear();

            while (countTime >= 0)
            {
                Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
                TimeSpan time = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(countTime);
                Console.Write("Time Remaining: " + time.ToString(@"hh\:mm\:ss"));
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
                countTime--;
            }

            Console.Clear();
            Console.WriteLine("Countdown Complete!");
        }
    }
}
```

This script is a simple yet practical example of a console-based application in C#. It demonstrates basic console input/output, time manipulation, and multithreaded programming.

# Java Timer Script

This Java script is a simple timer application. It prompts the user to input a number of seconds, then counts down from that number to zero, printing the remaining time to the console every second.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses three imported libraries:

1. `java.util.Scanner`: This library is used to read the user's input from the console. In this script, it is used to get the number of seconds for the timer.

2. `java.util.Timer`: This library is used to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread. In this script, it is used to create a new timer that executes a task every second.

3. `java.util.TimerTask`: This library is a task that can be scheduled for one-time or repeated execution by a Timer. In this script, it is used to define the task that is executed every second, which is to print the remaining time and decrement the interval.

## Code Explanation

The `main` method starts by creating a new `Scanner` to read the user's input. It then prompts the user to input a number of seconds and reads this input.

Next, it creates a new `Timer` and sets the interval to the user's input. It also defines the delay and period for the timer task as 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.

The timer is then scheduled to execute a new `TimerTask` every second after an initial delay of 1 second. The task's `run` method calls the `setInterval` method, which prints the remaining time and decrements the interval.

The `setInterval` method checks if the interval is 1, and if so, it cancels the timer. This stops the countdown when it reaches zero. It then returns the decremented interval.

This script is a simple example of how to use the `Timer` and `TimerTask` classes in Java to schedule tasks for repeated execution.
